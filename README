A drop-type file management system.

Many folders, which can be accessed by users and/or groups.

Admin interface for back-end

Authenticatin based on Ryan Bates Screencast http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch
Basics of system from http://www.prowl.in/sharebox.html



Developed in rails 3, using existing gems.
Users require manual approval before continuing. (probably be config option in future)

Getting started:
	bundle install
	rake db:setup
	rails s
	
Admin user added by running:
	rake db:seed
	
Admin user details: 
	Username - admin@admin.com
	Password - admin

CAVEAT: Some of the functionality is done due to current user expectations - even though its dirty.

You will need to add your administrator's email address in config..example.txt and rename this to config.txt to receive emails about users being registered
